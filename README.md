# 🚀 React - Food

### _Built as part of the [Namaste React Live Course](https://namastedev.com/learn/namaste-react?_aff=946684804112) by [Akshay Saini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshaymarch7/), Founder of [NamasteDev](https://namastedev.com/?_aff=946684804112)_


This repository contains assignments, class notes, and hands-on projects developed during the course.  
One of the major projects is the [🚀 Food App 😍](https://food-reactjss.netlify.app/), built entirely from scratch using **React.js** and **Parcel.js**.

> 💡 _This project serves as a React learning journey, where each chapter explores and demonstrates core React concepts with a dedicated live mini-app._


## 🌐 Live Demo

🧪 **Try the app live:**

📦 **API Proxy Server:**  
[https://food-reactjs-server.onrender.com/](https://food-reactjs-server.onrender.com/)


## 🔧 CORS Issue Fix

To handle **CORS** errors encountered during development, I’ve created a backend proxy using Render:

## 🧠 Learning

An educational project designed as a React.js tutorial, covering key concepts chapter by chapter. Each chapter focuses on a specific topic and includes a live working app, helping reinforce React fundamentals through hands-on practice.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each chapter represents a standalone React concept or feature, structured as its own working mini-app.
