# Chapter 12 - Lets build our store (Redux)

## Coding Assignment:

*In this chapter, we will use @reduxjs/toolkit & react-redux which is the newer way of wrtting redux.* 

- Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux.
- Build our store.
- Connect our store to our app.
- Slice (cartSlice).
- dispatch(action).
- Selector


## Redux

Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, most commonly used with React. It provides a centralized store to manage application state in a predictable way.

We can assume Redux store is like big object kept in a global central space to manage application state.
Redux offers easy debugging.

### Redux Data Flow

#### Writing to the Store
1. User clicks a button
2. dispacth the action
3. Reducer function is called
4. update the slice of redux store.

#### Reading from the Store
1. Use useSelector() to subscribe to the store.
2. Component automatically re-renders when the selected slice changes.

### üõ†Ô∏è Core Concepts
  - Store ‚Äì holds your entire app‚Äôs state.
  - Dispatch ‚Äì sends actions to the store.
  - Actions ‚Äì plain objects that describe what happened.
  - Reducers ‚Äì pure functions that update state based on actions.
  - Selectors ‚Äì retrieve parts of the state.
